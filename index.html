    <h1>IDG1100 OBLIG</h1>

    <h3>1. What components are part of the Von Neuman Architecture</h3>
    <p>A central processing unit, a control unit, a memory unit, external mass storage and input/output mechanisms</p>


    <h3>2. What is user space?</h3>
    <p>Where the user is in control. Outside the kernel, but the user space can have multiple programs and libraries
        that interact with the kernel</p>

    <h3>3. What is the shell?</h3>
    <p>Tool for manipulating data and executing several applications. There is multiple shells to choose from, and can
        be used as an access to operating systems services</p>

    <h3>4. Where is the shell located?</h3>
    <p>The shell is a part of the user space. By typing in a terminal or running scripts, we are interacting with the
        system, and therefore using a shell.</p>

    <h3>5. What is the main task of the shell?</h3>
    <p>Provides a command line interface to make it possible for a user to communicate with a operating system.</p>

    <h3>6. What is the octal representation of a file that can be read and written only by its owner?</h3>
    <p>-rw-------</p>

    <h3>7. In UNIX systems, what is the common name of the special user that can access and modify every file?</h3>
    <p>root</p>

    <h3>8. Which file permission classes are available in UNIX systems?</h3>
    <p>Read, write and execute</p>

    <h3>9. As of 2020, which percentage of servers have UNIX-like OS?</h3>
    <p>More than 70%</p>

    <h3>10. The command ssh will:</h3>
    <p>Securly login to a remote computer over a network</p>

    <h3>11. UNIX Command: access your current working directory</h3>
    <code>pwd</code>

    <h3>12. UNIX Command: rename files (give an example)</h3>
    <code>mv test.txt test2.txt</code>

    <h3>13. UNIX Command: schedule the execution of programs in the future</h3>
    <code>*/30 */2 * * * /home/thomas/bash.sh > /home/thomas/log/bash-file.txt</code>

    <h3>14. UNIX Command: Forcefully shutdown the command with process ID 123</h3>
    <code>kill 123</code>

    <h3>15. UNIX Command: access your root user</h3>
    <code>sudo su</code>

    <h3>16. Crontab scheduled: At minute 30 on Sunday.</h3>
    <code>30 * * * 0 /home/thomas/bash.sh > /home/thomas/log/bash-file.txt</code>

    <h3>17. Crontab scheduled: At minute 30 on day-of-month 15.</h3>
    <code>30 * 15 * * /home/thomas/bash.sh > /home/thomas/log/bash-file.txt</code>

    <h3>18. Crontab scheduled: At 05:30 on every day-of-week from Sunday through Monday in June.</h3>
    <code>30 5 * 6 * /home/thomas/bash.sh > /home/thomas/log/bash-file.txt</code>

    <h3>19. Script: print your name and date</h3>
    <code>
        #!/bin/bash<br>
        echo "Thomas - $(date)"
    </code>

    <h3>20. Script: add two numeric values, print the result</h3>
    <code>
        #!/bin/bash<br>
        num1=2<br>
        num2=3<br>
        sum=$((num1+num2))<br>
        echo $sum
    </code>

    <h3>21. Script: inputs username, prints “USERNAME stored”</h3>
    <code>
        #!/bin/bash<br>
        echo Enter your username<br>
        read username<br>
        echo $username stored
    </code>

    <h3>22. Script: Store the output of the command “hostname” in a variable. Display “This script is
        running on _.” where “_” is the output of the “hostname” command.</h3>
    <code>
        #!/bin/bash<br>
        host=$HOSTNAME<br>
        echo This script is running on $host

    </code>

    <h3>23. Script: Store the output of the working directory (from where the script is run) in a variable
        then print the variable.</h3>
    <code>
        #!/bin/bash <br>
        dir=$PWD <br>
        echo $dir
    </code>

    <h3>24. Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints “Task scheduled at” +
        DATE. Cronjob is scheduled every 30 minutes on today’s date (only today).</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open your favorite UNIX terminal</li>
        <li>Use the following command to create a file to be executed (nano task.sh)</li>
        <li>Insert the following code into the file</li>
        <code>
                #!/bin/bash <br>
                echo "Task scheduled at $(date)"
            </code>
        <li>Save the file by pressing ctrl + o, and enter to confirm. </li>
        <li>Exit the file by pressing ctrl + x</li>
        <li>Make sure that the file is executable by running the following command (chmod +x task.sh)</li>
        <li>Run the command (crontab -e) to start a new crontab</li>
        <li>At the bottom of the file enter the following code. */30 * 15 11 * means run every 30 minutes the 15th of
            november, task.sh is the file you want to run, task-log.txt is the file that will hold the output of task.sh
        </li>
        <code>
                */30 * 15 11 * /home/thoma/task.sh >> /home/thoma/task-log.txt
            </code>
        <li>ctrl + o to save, ctrl + x to exit</li>
        <li>File should now be executed every 30 minutes the 15th of november</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question.
        The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be
        chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of
        the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting
        the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
        changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the
        menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer</h3>
    <code>
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Enter the letter you would like to know the answer to"
        echo "a. How many people live in Europe?"
        echo "b. What is the capital of China?"
        echo "c. What is the warmest registered temperature in Norway?"
        echo ""
        echo "Type x to show this menu again!"
        echo "Type q to quit"

        while true; do
            read -p 'Enter your letter: ' input
            case "$input" in
                [a]* )
                    echo 'There is 741.4 million people in Europe.';;
                [b]* )
                    echo 'Capital of china is Beijing!';;
                [c]* )
                    echo 'The hottest was 35.6 degrees';;
                [q]* )
                    exit 0;;
                * )
                    echo "Enter the letter you would like to know the answer to"
                    echo "a. How many people live in europe?"
                    echo "b. What is the capital of China?"
                    echo "c. What is the warmest registered temperature in Norway?"
                    echo ""
                    echo "Type x to show this menu again!"
                    echo "Type q to quit";;
            esac
        done
    </code>
